# FPGA---Clock-Divider-7-Segment-Multiplexing
This project implements a clock divider and a multi-digit 7-segment display driver on the Digilent Nexys 3 FPGA board. It demonstrates how to take a 100 MHz input clock and divide it down to 500 Hz, then use that signal to drive all four digits of the 7-segment display simultaneously, showing the sequence `4321`.
